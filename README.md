## Description📝
We wanted to design an application that supports communication between students at Bilkent University. Although communication has been provided through social media accounts associated with our university until now, this communication is sometimes discontinuous and not regular. With this application, we aim to establish a platform that creates a safe space for only Bilkent members where they can connect with each other. CampusConnect will be a platform where students can buy second-hand items, and borrow and locate lost items. They can also donate their items to other students. Besides increasing the bonds between the students, CampusConnect will be a safer platform for Bilkent students since it is an application for the university and people will register via their university ID. Moreover, to promote the people for their good deeds inside CampusConect will reward the users with badges. The products on the website will respond to Bilkent students' needs, so it is tailored for them. It is important to have elaborative information about the item, so communication is key for the CampusConnect. Students will be able to send direct messages to each other inside the platform, so there will be no need to use Bilkent mail. There is a part called "FreeZone". In this part, students will be able to communicate similarly to Instagram, however, it will be a safer place for the students since there will be no one from outside of Bilkent, and all people will be registered with their ID. It will reduce the risk of cyberbullying. It will also decrease the need for another platform. Bilkent students will continue to stay on the platform since they can chat with their friends(direct messages), and they will be able to see a feed from all Bilkenters. If they need something related to the university, CampusConnect will be the platform.
## Why CampusConnect? 🤔🎓
"CampusConnect", whose admins and founders are students of our university, is a unique application that connects the respected members of Bilkent. It is much more than an e-commerce app; it strengthens the bond between people at our university and helps connect new bonds.
### Our Motivation 🔥
Our motivation for creating CampusConnect is to provide a reliable platform for Bilkent members to find products that they need for their lessons and easily locate the spot for their lost items. They can easily borrow, sell, donate, and also chat freely on a safe platform. 
### Our Goal 🎯
Every start of an academic semester can be overwhelming for students because each lesson requires different books, and electronics most of which are over-budget. This leads students to buy second-hand items. However, it is a big question whether to trust the seller or not. Therefore, we wanted to create a platform that focuses on making Bilkenters' lives easier and safer by limiting the selling, borrowing, and donating process only to Bilkent members. Also, the Freezone feature creates a fun and safe place where students can escape from the stressful times of their lives.
### Interesting/Cool Factors 🚀
Campus Connect will not be a platform that only students can use for our features 🎓; as a development team, we are planning to support users in performing good deeds 👏. We plan to award them with in-app achievements and badges 🏅 when they do something good on the website 🌐 such as donating or being reliable in second-hand sales. Moreover, Freezone will be a platform for Bilkent students to socialize in a safe place 🛑🎉. We believe that communication is the key for people 🗣️, so users will be able to use direct messages 📩 for communication with their friends or for obtaining more information about an item 🕵️.
### Selling Factors ✨
The selling points of Campus Connect are its unique features: Freezone and Livechat. Encouraging people to donate and give ratings for reliable people is also a factor that will encourage people to use Campus Connect.
## Features 🛠️
- **Lost & Found Items🔍:** When a Bilkent ID is lost, the loser will enter their ID number into a specified field, and if anyone has already informed the app that they have found that specific ID, they will be matched and the loser will get their ID back instantly. The difference from any other loss is that when a Bilkent ID is lost, no one will see it or be notified due to privacy reasons as it will be a fully anonymous process. If anything other than an ID card is lost, the regarding post will be shared in a feed for lost items; if anything is found other than an ID card, the regarding post will be shared in a feed for found items. When a lost item is found, the regarding post for that specific lost item will be marked as "FOUND!".
